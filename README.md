For simplicity I added the compiled .exe into the repo so you don't have to worry about compiling it.

Once you run the .exe you can draw in the cells with LMB and erase with RMB,
Start and pause the simulation with SPACE,
BACKSPACE to erace the board,
And also ESCAPE to close the window,

Credits for most of the code goes to this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD9IJ7LOK7E,
If you want to use some of this code in your projects feel free
